You pretty much covered everything for board and ship pretty well.
Maybe there was a comment but I missed it, but is shipDirection supposed to help with
how to place the ship on the board? And location is meant to be the back of the ship?

Are there default sizes for these ships? Should they be hardcoded with #define
statements?


-Yes, the files have been updated further, but shipDirection is used when placing ships and is stored for each ship.

-The location is the back of the ship.

-I was thinking the ship sizes would be stored in some external file and read by main in case someone wanted to mod the game
 but we can hard code them if you guys want. **** SEE UPDATE 1 ****

**** UPDATE 1 ****
Upon further review, I decided that you were correct, and I added the ship lengths into Ship.h as #define's
